# Fortran-numerics
some numerical calculations with Fortran



In the repository some numerical algorithms from mechanics and physics are presented.

The problems are selected and solved by sampling. If an analytical solution exists for a problem, it is used for validation.

Since most of the technical-physical problems are relatively complex, one can not ignore numerical methods. Fortran 90/95 should be used as a tool. The language has been developed for mathematical modeling and offers not only convenient functions but also very good speed.

stay tuned !
